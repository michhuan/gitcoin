Catastrophe is composed of kata, "down", plus strephein, "turn".  https://www.etymonline.com/word/catastrophe

The eu- prefix means "good" or "well".  https://www.etymonline.com/word/eu-

If eu- is combined with strephein, the result is eustrophe, "good turn".

An example of the word in use:
"Perhaps we need to borrow a concept from theology, namely that of the eustrophe - a discontinuous event which produces a historically beneficial outcome..."
Bryan S. Turner, Social History of Medicine, Volume 6, Issue 3, December 1993, Pages 439â€“440, https://doi.org/10.1093/shm/6.3.439

Eustrophe avoids the negative connotations of eucatastrophe while retaining its meaning of a "good surprise".
